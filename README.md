# search_vulns
Search for known vulnerabilities in software using software titles or a CPE 2.3 string.

## About
*search_vulns* can be used to search for known vulnerabilities in software. To achieve this, the tool utilizes a locally built vulnerability database, currently containing:

* CVE information from the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
* Exploit information from the [Exploit-DB (EDB)](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
* Exploit information from [PoC-in-GitHub](https://github.com/nomi-sec/PoC-in-GitHub)
* Software currency information from [endoflife.date](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date)

Using the *search_vulns* tool, this local information can be queried, either by providing software titles like 'Apache 2.4.39' or by providing a CPE 2.3 string like ``cpe:2.3:a:sudo_project:sudo:1.8.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*``.

*search_vulns* can either be used as a CLI tool or via a web server. It is recommended to use the CLI tool for automated workflows that might be resource-constrained. Otherwise, using the web server is recommended, because it offers more features and flexibility. This includes the ability to achieve more complete results. Also, the presentation of results is clearer and results can be exported for further use.

## Installation
You can perform a quick install by running the following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ra1nb0rn/search_vulns
cd search_vulns
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
git submodule init
git submodule update
./search_vulns.py -u
```

Alternatively, for a full install, run the ``install.sh`` script (*note that it is configured to ``--break-system-packages`` for installing Python dependencies*). First, this script automatically installs the required dependencies. Thereafter it downloads the required software and vulnerability resources (see the [Release artifacts](https://github.com/ra1nb0rn/search_vulns/releases/latest)). These resources can also be built directly by invoking the install script with the according flag: ``install.sh --full``. Note, however, that this may take more time than simply downloading the resources. Of course, you can also look at the installation script and set up everything manually. Finally, you can also use the provided ``Dockerfile`` to build a container:
```
docker build -t search_vulns .
```
and then start it:
```
docker run -it search_vulns
```
or with an exposed port for the web server:
```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 -it search_vulns
```
Note that here you have to update the host and port accordingly in the ``app.run`` call in [``web_server.py``](https://github.com/ra1nb0rn/search_vulns/blob/master/web_server.py).

  --use-created-cpes    If no matching CPE exists in the software database, automatically use a

```
Note that when querying software with ``-q`` you have to put the software information in quotes if it contains any spaces. Also, you can use ``-q`` multiple times to make multiple queries at once. For one, a query can be a software name / title like 'Apache 2.4.39' or 'Wordpress 5.7.2'. Furthermore, a query can also be a [CPE 2.3](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol/specifications/cpe) string.

Here are some examples:
* Query *Sudo 1.8.2* for known vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  $ ./search_vulns.py -q 'Sudo 1.8.2'

  [+] Sudo 1.8.2 (cpe:2.3:a:sudo_project:sudo:1.8.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*)
  CVE-2019-14287 (CVSSv3.1/8.8): In Sudo before 1.8.28, an attacker with access to a Runas ALL sudoer account can bypass certain policy blacklists and session PAM modules, and can cause incorrect logging, by invoking sudo with a crafted user ID. For example, this allows bypass of !root configuration, and USER= logging, for a "sudo -u \#$((0xffffffff))" command.

  CVE-2017-1000368 (CVSSv3.0/8.2): Todd Miller's sudo version 1.8.20p1 and earlier is vulnerable to an input validation (embedded newlines) in the get_process_ttyname() function resulting in information disclosure and command execution.

  ```
* Query *Moodle 3.4.0* for known vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  $ ./search_vulns.py -q 'Moodle 3.4.0'

  [+] Moodle 3.4.0 (cpe:2.3:a:moodle:moodle:3.4.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*)
  CVE-2018-14630 (CVSSv3.0/8.8): moodle before versions 3.5.2, 3.4.5, 3.3.8, 3.1.14 is vulnerable to an XML import of ddwtos could lead to intentional remote code execution. When importing legacy 'drag and drop into text' (ddwtos) type quiz questions, it was possible to inject and execute PHP code from within the imported questions, either intentionally or by importing questions from an untrusted source.
  Reference: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14630, 2018-09-17
  CVE-2018-1133 (CVSSv3.0/8.8): An issue was discovered in Moodle 3.x. A Teacher creating a Calculated question can intentionally cause remote code execution on the server, aka eval injection.

  [...]
  ```
Again, note that when *search_vulns* is initially installed, it takes quite some time to set up the local vulnerability and software database.

## Running a Web Server
It is also possible to run a web server that provides this tool's functionality to clients over the network. ``web_server.py`` contains a working example using Flask. Depending on your environment, you may want to modify the server IP and port at the end of this file. To run a simple Flask web server, just run:
```bash
./web_server.py
```
Furthermore, you can use ``gunicorn`` to make the web server more scalable; for example by running:
```bash
gunicorn --worker-class=gevent --worker-connections=50 --workers=3 --bind '0.0.0.0:8000' wsgi:app
```
You can read more about choosing good ``gunicorn`` settings for your system [here](https://medium.com/building-the-system/gunicorn-3-means-of-concurrency-efbb547674b7). Note, however, that this tool is quite CPU intensive, meaning that scalability is somewhat limited.

Finally, you can also use Nginx as a reverse proxy. A sample configuration file is provided in [``web_server_files/nginx.conf.sample``](https://github.com/ra1nb0rn/search_vulns/blob/master/web_server_files/nginx.conf.sample). Again, you may have to adjust this to your needs. When using Nginx, make sure you have the app running at the configured endpoint(s). For the sample configuration file, for example, you would have to run something similar to the following:
```bash
gunicorn --worker-class=gevent --worker-connections=50 --workers=3 --bind 'unix:/tmp/gunicorn.sock' wsgi:app
```

## MariaDB as Alternative Database Option
search_vulns can be configured to use *MariaDB* as an alternative to the preconfigured *SQLite* mechanism. A sample configuration file for MariaDB is provided in [``config_mariadb.json``](https://github.com/ra1nb0rn/search_vulns/blob/master/config_mariadb.json).

Make sure that you adjust the values for MariaDB in the configuration file to your MariaDB deployment (*user*, *password*, *host* and *port*).

To use MariaDB instead of *SQLite* for the webserver, simply change the ``CONFIG_FILE`` variable in ``web_server.py`` to your config file (e.g. ``config_mariadb.json``).

To improve the performance of search_vulns with MariaDB, it is recommend to add the following settings to your MariaDB configuration file (e.g. ``/etc/mysql/my.cnf``):
```
[mariadb]
query_cache_type = 1
query_cache_size = 192M
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 8G
thread_handling = pool-of-threads
```
``innodb_buffer_pool_size`` should be set to approximately 80% of available memory (see [MariaDB's official documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables/#innodb_buffer_pool_size)).
